# Embedded_Systems_F23_Final_Project

## Gesture Recognition Device
Final Project for the undergraduate Embedded Systems class at NYU Tandon School of engineering. This project consisted of creating a gesture recognition device using the Adafruit Circuit Playground classic which comes with the Atmel ATmega32u4 Processor.

This project was entirely done using the PlatformIO IDE extension for VScode.
